@echo off
REM Deploys the current working tree to the test system over SSH.
REM
REM There is no composer on the remote host, so production dependencies are
REM built locally (in a throwaway temp copy, so the developer's own vendor\
REM with dev dependencies like phpunit is left untouched) and shipped as
REM part of the upload. The actual upload uses PuTTY's plink.exe (not
REM ssh.exe) piped together with tar.exe - see the DEPLOY_SSH_PASSWORD block
REM below for why.
REM
REM The remote .env is never touched: it's excluded from the package, and
REM this script never deletes anything on the remote side, it only extracts
REM on top of what's already there. That also means files removed locally
REM are NOT removed from the remote - this is a simple "copy newer files
REM over", not a mirror.
REM
REM Only what the PHP app actually needs at runtime is uploaded. Everything
REM below is local dev/build-only tooling and is excluded (see the --exclude
REM list): android/ (the whole native Capacitor Android Studio project),
REM node_modules/ + package.json/package-lock.json + capacitor.config.json
REM (root-level npm/Capacitor tooling, unrelated to the PHP app's own
REM composer dependencies), assets/ (Capacitor app icon/splash source
REM images), tests/ (PHPUnit + the self-contained Playwright e2e project,
REM including ITS OWN node_modules/), docs/, .githooks/, .phpunit.cache/,
REM .playwright-mcp/ (Claude/Playwright MCP tool scratch output - gitignored
REM but not tar-ignored, so it would otherwise ship whatever happens to be
REM sitting in the working tree at deploy time).
REM
REM Usage: bin\deploy.bat
REM Override any of these by setting the env var before running, e.g.:
REM   set REMOTE_PHP=php8.1
REM   bin\deploy.bat

REM Delayed expansion (!var!) stays OFF on purpose: DEPLOY_SSH_PASSWORD is
REM used later as a plain %-expanded value, and if it ever contains a "!"
REM (this file's own does), delayed expansion's own "!...!" scanning could
REM mangle it on the command line. Nothing in this script needs !var! syntax.
