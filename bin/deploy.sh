# Deploys the current working tree to the test system over SSH.
#
# There is no `composer` on the remote host, so production dependencies are
# built locally (in a throwaway copy, so the developer's own vendor/ with
# dev dependencies like phpunit is left untouched) and shipped as part of
# the upload. rsync isn't available on this dev machine, so the transfer
# uses `tar` piped through `ssh` instead - one connection, one archive.
#
# The remote .env is never touched: it's excluded from the package, and
# this script never deletes anything on the remote side, it only extracts
# on top of what's already there. Note that also means files removed
# locally are NOT removed from the remote - this is a simple "copy newer
# files over", not a mirror.
#
# Usage: bin/deploy.sh
# Override any of these via environment variables, e.g.:
#   REMOTE_PHP=php8.1 bin/deploy.sh
